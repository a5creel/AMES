# AMES
This repository contains the notes I prepared as a teaching fellow for Eli Fenichel's Applied Math for Environmental Scientists Course at the Yale School of the Environment in the Fall of 2023. 

The repository has two primary folders, `class notes` and `section notes`. `Class notes` are taken during Eli's in-class lectures. `Section notes` are prepared by myself before Monday evening sections. I do not expect you to read the section notes before the section. However, they can be helpful to have in front of you during section. 

Note: You can ignore the .tex files. The PDFs are what are viewable and what you want! The .tex files are just how I make the pdfs. 


### Office hours
My office hours are Mondays from 5:30 - 7 p.m. in Kroon G01. The first half will be my prepared material, which will prepare you for the problem sets. The second half will be open office hours where I can answer any questions.
